# All Things Python

## Python 
Installation/Requirements:
I used Python version 3.7.7 for all of the analysis, which you can download here.  
	https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/

Pip Install Packages
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

By running `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the command line you can install all of the packages from that file.  Comb through these to see which ones you really do/don't need.

## Conda
Current Version: conda 4.10.3
